# ML Experiments

An open source framework for orchestrating machine learning research experiments based
on the popular `ml-collections` library.
`ml-experiments` allows you to define a configuration object in the style of
`ml-collections` that describes an array of experiments, run all of the experiments,
gather artifacts from the experiments, and aggregate the results into plots, tables,
and figures for use in your research paper.
